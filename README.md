# BadRefSR
Official PyTorch implementation of the paper BadRefSR: Backdoor Attacks Against Reference-based Image Super Resolution.

#Introduction
We propose a novel attack framework called BadRefSR, which embeds backdoors in the Reference-based image super-resolution(RefSR) model by adding triggers to the reference images and training with a mixed loss function.

#Dataset
We provide CUFED datasets and the CUFED5 test set with Blend trigger and the pretrained weight file at a poisoning rate of 20%.
