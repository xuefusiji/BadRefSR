# BadRefSR.
Official PyTorch implementation of the paper BadRefSR: Backdoor Attacks Against Reference-based Image Super Resolution.

# Introduction.
We propose a novel attack framework called BadRefSR, which embeds backdoors in the Reference-based image super-resolution(RefSR) model by adding triggers to the reference images and training with a mixed loss function.

# Dataset.
We provide CUFED datasets and the CUFED5 test set with Blend trigger.

# Model.
We have conducted experiments of BadRefSR on two RefSR models, TTSR and MASA-SR.

# the pretrained weight file.
We provide the pretrained weight file with Blend trigger at a poisoning rate of 20% (链接: https://pan.baidu.com/s/1wLkvxT-ht-T4Cw6PX0NE1Q?pwd=p9uy 提取码: p9uy).
